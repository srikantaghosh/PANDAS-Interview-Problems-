How can we use Python to identify potential fraudulent transactions in a banking dataset?

Given a banking dataset with information such as Customer_Id, City, Max_withdrawal limit, withdrawal amount, and age, we need to write a Python query to add a new column indicating whether a customer is classified as a fraud or not based on their withdrawal behavior.

Specifically, we want to identify cases where the withdrawal amount exceeds the maximum transaction limit set for each customer. If such an occurrence is detected, the new column will be assigned a value indicating that the customer is a fraud.
